## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 220, 60%, 50% (approximately #3D83FF). This choice evokes a sense of trust, intelligence, and efficiency. Blue is often associated with professionalism, making it suitable for a KPI dashboard that provides key business insights.
- Background color: HSL 220, 20%, 95% (approximately #F0F2FA). A very light tint of blue to provide a clean and professional backdrop without distracting from the data visualizations.
- Accent color: HSL 190, 50%, 50% (approximately #40B0A0). An analogous color providing a complementary, fresh feeling to highlight CTAs or important metrics.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) provides a clean, modern, and easily readable typeface for dashboards. It ensures legibility and a professional appearance.
- Simple and consistent line icons. Icons should be related to KPI categories and data visualizations.
- A clean, grid-based layout to maintain balance and provide a sense of order, ensuring data is easily located and digestible.
- Subtle transitions and animations to indicate data updates or changes in KPIs.
